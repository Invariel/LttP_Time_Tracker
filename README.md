# LttP_Time_Tracker
     A simple time-tracking tool for The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past
and its randomizer.

     Enter your time, items found, deaths, fairie revivals, and your game
flags, and maintain a list of all of your times.  Then use the Statistics page
to look at your times for particular flag settings.  Want to see how well you
do in Coop?  It's there.  Want to see your Multiworld, swordless, hard mode
times?  It's there.  Want to know how long you've spent on LttP Randomizer
seeds since you started using this tool?  You can!

# Why?
     Because people are so concerned with their personal best while running
randomizer, but I think that average time is a much better indicator of
progress.  Anyone can breeze through a god seed, but your average score will
tell you that you are actually improving.
